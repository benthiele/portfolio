### 2. Dog Breed Classification Streamlit App
**Folder:** `computer_vision_streamlit_app`

An interactive Streamlit application that allows users to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify dog breeds using custom datasets.

- Enables users to upload images for multiple dog breeds
- Trains a CNN model on the uploaded dataset
- Provides functionality to classify new, unseen images
